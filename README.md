# Grype

Idea for a useless art/notes tool: a grid where you can draw winding cells and type within them; when typing would make it overflow the cell, it expands, turning if needed (preferring CCW I think) or prevents typing if it can't expand  
Text follows the winding path of the cell, including going backwards / upside down  

and maybe images can be pasted into the grid, so you could do like winding captions around them  

Project name: Grype - grid type  
Tagline: "if you have gripes with this tool, just know that it didn't have a purpose in creating it"
